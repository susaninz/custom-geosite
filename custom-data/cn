# Minimal "cn" stub for Mihomo compatibility
# 
# Mihomo/Clash.Meta validates geosite.dat by checking if category "cn" exists.
# If "cn" is missing, it considers the file invalid and re-downloads it.
# 
# This stub provides a minimal "cn" category with one placeholder domain
# to pass validation WITHOUT adding thousands of real Chinese domains.
# 
# This saves ~150KB+ in geosite.dat size and significant RAM on routers.
# 
# See: https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo/blob/Alpha/component/geodata/utils.go#L55
